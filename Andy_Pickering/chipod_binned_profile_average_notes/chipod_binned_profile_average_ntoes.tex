\section{Overview}

Comparing average profiles of $\chi$pod estimates (assuming $\gamma=0.2$) to Chameleon data for the EQ08 and EQ14 experiments. Individual $\chi$pod estimates tend to be biased low, but if we average many profiles together do the average profiles agree?

\section{Comparing time-averaged profiles of $\epsilon$}

%Looking at median values and scatterplots might be a little misleading. Maybe what we care about most is the mean profile of $\epsilon$ (or $K_{\rho}$ and $\chi$ (or $K_T$), which are probably dominated by just a small number of large values. 
%
%Figure \ref{epsrathist} shows the ratio of $\epsilon$ estimates (averaged in 10m bins from each profiles) from the $\chi$pod method to chameleon $\epsilon$ values, for both $\chi$pod method applied to 1m binned profiles, and applied to just patches. In such a point-by-point comparsion, the patch estimates have a smaller bias.
%
%
%Figure \ref{eps_prof_comp} shows averaged profiles of $\epsilon$ for several 500-profile chunks of the EQ0-8 data. The average profile of $\chi$pod estimates using 1m bins (`bin') tend to agree well with the chameleon average profile, if $\chi$pod estimates where $log_{10}\epsilon>-4$ are discarded (these are likely bad data due to extremely small dTdz). In fact, the average profile constructed from the binned $\chi$pod estimates tends to agree better than the patch profile.

\section{$\gamma$ computed from averaged quantities}

If we compute gamma from time-averaged $N^2,T_z,\chi,\epsilon$ do we get $\gamma=0.2$? Estimates from the averaged data are larger (Figures \ref{gambox_eq08},\ref{gambox_eq14}) but still slightly less than 0.2 .

\section{How many profiles need to be averaged to converge?}

Next I wanted to see how many profiles we need to average for the $\chi$pod profile to converge to the chameleon profile. Obviously this will depend on the specific profiles used and the characteristics of the turbulence, but here they seem to converge after about 100-150 profiles.

\section{Normalized eps vs chi plots}

Assuming that
\begin{equation}
\gamma=\frac{N^2 \chi}{2\epsilon<T_z>^2}
\end{equation}
, plotting [$\epsilon/N\^2$] vs [$\chi/t_{z}^{2}$] should follow a straight line with slope equal to $1/2\gamma$.

\section{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inidivudal (and 10m binned) $\chi$pod estimates of $\epsilon$ are biased low compared to Chameleon values.
\item When many profiles are averaged in 10m bins, the average profiles of $\epsilon$ agree better.
\item $\gamma$ computed from averaged (across profiles) $N^2$, $T_z$, $\chi$, and $\epsilon$ is larger, but not quite 0.2 (mean is around 0.1?)
\item Average profiles seem to converge after about 100 profiles?
\end{itemize}
