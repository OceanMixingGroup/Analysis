# Analyses by Andy Pickering.

This repository contains code and results of analysis done by Andy Pickerin as postdoc at OSU.


## Effect of sampling speed on overturns 
- Motivated by computing overturns from moored profiler (MP) data during IWISE. Wanted to see how the finite sampling speed affected overturn calculations (overturns assume instantaneous profile).

## chi-pod processing routines
- Developed standard Matlab routines for processing CTD-chipod data from cruises.

## EQ14 chameleon/chi-pod analysis 
- Tested chi-pod method by applying it to Chameleon thermistor data, from EQ14 profiles, and comparing to epsilon derived from shear probes.
- Compared CTD-chipod profiles to Chameleon profiles.

## EQ08 chameleon/chi-pod analysis 
- Tested chi-pod method by applying it to Chameleon thermistor data, from EQ08 profiles, and comparing to epsilon derived from shear probes.

## Global patterns from microstructure database
- Looked at relationships between chi and epsilon, estimated mixing efficencies, and epsilon estimated from chi, for several global microstructure datasets.

## Gamma calculations
Calculated mixing efficiency from EQ14 chameleon profiles, using binned data and data computed over patches only.
