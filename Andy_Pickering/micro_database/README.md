- Looking at patterns of mixing data from several global datasets contained in the microstructure database that Amy put together (<https://microstructure.ucsd.edu/) 

- Specifically, I look at estimated mixing efficiencies, and how epsilon computed from chi compares to epsilon from shear probes.

- Motivation was to try to get some context for the chi-pod analysis I did w/ the EQ08 and EQ14 data, and see if patterns were similar at other locations.

See <https://github.com/OceanMixingGroup/Analysis/blob/master/Andy_Pickering/micro_database/micro_data_notes.pdf> for overview of results.
